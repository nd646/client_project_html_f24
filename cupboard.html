            <p>College students and staff are experiencing food insecurity at alarming rates. The Maize and Blue Cupboard is here to provide an immediate and comprehensive response for the U-M community. By offering resources, educational opportunities, compassionate support and more, we help students develop the skills to make informed decisions.</p>

        <div>
            <p>There’s no limit on food. Take what you need, but eat what you take. We’re set up like a grocery store, so you have free choice to choose what you prefer to eat. You might see suggested portions for certain food items. This is to help ensure we don’t run out of high-demand items. If there is something else you’d like to see in the space, let us know.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Appointments can be scheduled up to two weeks in advance, on a rolling basis. Appointments can be scheduled based on need. If you regularly shop twice per week, please schedule two shopping appointments. However, only schedule appointments for times you plan to visit the Maize and Blue Cupboard.</p>
