            <p>Established in 1964, the Center for the Education of Women+ was a pioneering university women’s center. Designed to serve the needs of women students as well as women returning to school or work, CEW+ (then known as the Center for the Continuing Education of Women) was founded with a three-part mission of service, advocacy, and research. The Center for the Education of Women+ (now known as CEW+) continues its work today, serving University students, staff and faculty, community members, and all genders, facing education, employment, or other life issues.</p>

            <p>CEW+ provides immediate and ongoing services and the financial support needed to ensure educational success and degree completion. Women+ and underserved students are CEW+’s primary constituency, but all students are welcome. CEW+ also serves those who encounter education and career obstacles based on their non-linear paths to, and experiences within, the University community.</p>
